This repository houses three small Max applications created as solutions to problems assigned in an electroacoustic music composition course taught at the Florida Electroacoustic Music Studio.

These projects are intended to demonstrate my particular approach to solving the assigned problems and do not represent solutions that have been particularly ardously tested.

Most of these projects are fairly small and simple. Do note, however, that application 3 is an implementation of John Conway's Game of Life written using a Matrix object and JavaScript ;]
